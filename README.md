Objective-C meets Lisp in one weird language.

## Language

The language is very simple. There are only a handful of syntactic rules.

- `[object method: arg0 arg1]`: Call a method on an object
- `[function: arg0 arg1]`: Call a function (functions are also objects)
- `[function]`: Call a function with no arguments
- `"foo"`: A string literal (numbers work as expected)

## Options

None so far. Edit the `input` var in `core.clj` if you would like to test
different programs.

## Examples

```
[let a: "foo"]
[print: a]
//=> foo
```

## Docs

Docs are available in the `doc` directory. Build them with VuePress by running
```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
And opening `localhost:8080` in a browser. You can also just read the docs from
markdown on the GitLab site. Also, if the pipeline starts working, you will be
able to read the docs at [swisschili.github.io/crisp](https://swisschili.github.io/crisp).
