Objective-C meets Lisp in one weird language.

## Language

The language is very simple. There are only a handful of syntactic rules.

- `[object method: arg0 arg1]`: Call a method on an object
- `[function: arg0 arg1]`: Call a function (functions are also objects)
- `[function]`: Call a function with no arguments
- `"foo"`: A string literal (numbers work as expected)

## Options

None so far

## Examples

*Does not currently run:*

```
[let a: "foo"]
[a print]
//=> foo
```
